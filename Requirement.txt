Using Python, design a program to determine the Total charge for a Rental Car. The program accepts the customer name, car type and days of rental. The base charge for any rental is $65. Car types include Compact, Standard, SUV, Van. Additional fees per day are charged for Standard - $10, SUV - $15, Van - $25. If renting for more than 7 days, a 20% discount is given. The program should display the details of the transaction and a total charge.
